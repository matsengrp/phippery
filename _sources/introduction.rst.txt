Introduction
============

Welcome to the documentation for ``phippery``. 
We present a software suite of data analysis tools for 
`Phage Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq) <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-018-0025-6>`_ [#PhIPSeq]_,
a high-throughput phage-display sequencing technique.
All the tools presented here are 
designed for flexibility and general purpose, suitable for
either *commonly used* (e.g. Virscan) 
or *highly customized* phage-display libraries 
(e.g. Phage-DMS).

We encourage bug reporting and all other
helpful feedback --
the source code for ``phippery`` can be found at 
https://github.com/matsengrp/phippery. For more 
on contributing, see the 
:ref:`contributing <sec_contribute>` page.

  **Software tools schematic:** A cartoon flow 
  chart description of the workflow using
  each of the tools of ``phippery``.
  (A) Inputs from the experimentalist feed into
  the alignment pipeline. The inputs are: the list 
  of demultiplexed files (fastq) for the samples
  under study, along with an annotation table of
  relevant sample-specific information; a peptide
  table listing all peptides in the phage library
  and descriptors of interest (oligo sequence to 
  align sequencing reads to, virus, protein,
  locus, etc)
  (B) A python API to perform tasks such as 
  data wrangling or model fitting. 
  Most operations result in "layering"
  specific transformations onto the primary data
  structure. For more details on code structure and the 
  available CLI, see :ref:`under the hood <sec_under_the_hood>`.
  (C) An interactive browser-based application presents
  the layered data, allowing users to aggregate
  and visualize data by selecting on sample and peptide
  annotation features. The export functionality provides
  image files (of the visualization) or the
  underlying raw data (in tall or wide formats) for
  plotting with any of your favorite packages.

Getting Started
+++++++++++++++

- Head over to the :ref:`Installation <sec_install_intro>` 
  page to get installation instructions for each of the three tools described above.

- To get a feel for running each of the three related tools pictured above, 
  we suggest following a :ref:`walk through <sec_quick_start>` of running the
  alignments pipeline on some empirical data from `Stoddard et al. 2021 
  <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2021.109164>`_ [#Stoddard]_. 

- Check out the :ref:`running your own data <example_own_data>` section for a bare minimum
  approach to getting enrichment values from your own NGS data.

- Take a look at the :ref:`Nextflow pipeline <sec_cli_intro>` page for a better description
  of the pipeline and its features for downstream analysis.

Background
++++++++++

The advent of modern oligonucleotide synthesis allows researchers to generate
*highly* multiplexed assays such as PhIP-Seq, which is used to investigate
antibody-antigen interactions with comprehensive phage-display libraries.
The library used in VirScan [#VirScan]_, a general purpose application of PhIP-Seq, 
comprises :math:`\mathcal{O}(10^5)` peptides spanning over 1000 individual
strains across 206 species of virus. There are also specialized library designs,
such as in deep mutational scanning, for estimating the impact that mutations to
a viral protein may have on antibody binding [#PhageDMS]_.

Despite the growing use of the protocol, there is not yet an established set of
software tools for bioinformatics and computational tasks with PhIP-Seq data.
Much of the published code is specific to the authors' experiment, thus new researchers
are either piecing together snippets from others or developing scripts from scratch.
A goal of ``phippery`` is to provide some *efficient* and *unit-tested* general infrastructure
for computing enrichment, data formatting/storing/transforming, and other common analysis
functions. Each of the tools presented here can be used separately or in
conjunction for the rapid exploration of PhIP-Seq data.

Here we focus most heavily on the ``Nextflow`` pipeline as it provides a framework
for creating, modeling, and computing statistics on a PhIP-Seq dataset. 
The :ref:`pipeline inputs <sec_pipeline_inputs>` 
are demultiplexed fastq files for each of the sample IP's, 
as well as annotation tables
for samples and peptides -- CSV files with only a single column requirement each.
The default workflow then performs all of the major steps in processing the raw data and 
obtaining an enrichment dataset (along with some other optional statistical goodies).
The pipeline will output a pickled binary of the 
`xarray.DataSet <https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/generated/xarray.Dataset.html>`_ 
as described in :ref:`under the hood <sec_under_the_hood>`
, and/or optionally two common CSV formats
(`tall & wide <https://medium.com/w2hds/wide-tall-data-formats-423331ab5991>`_)
such that the user may query with their own favorite analysis tools.
